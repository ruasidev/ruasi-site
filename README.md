# Ethan's Website
I plan on making this my portfolio website, having different folders for different javascript projects and such.
I did all of the HTML and CSS in a single day and no-lifed the whole thing. When I get around to making more javascript projects they will appear in the "projects" tab in the website. 
I appreciate all that support me seriously <3

# This currently only works on a few platforms
