                <h1>My Story</h1>
                <p>I first learned the basics of HTML and CSS as a Sophomore in High School. That was the first time I ever programmed anything outside of the scracth website with block code. Only starting in 2020, I took an AP Computer Science Principals class as a Junior, and fell in love with programming. My dad had always been a computer person and we always did projects with computers whenever we got time to. I knew at some point between middle school and high school that I wanted to follow in his footsteps and go into computer science. Since then I have been coding as much as possible and doing as much research as possible, taking all of the opportunities that I can get, and that comes to where I am now.</p>

                <h2>Where I am now</h2>
                <p>As of February 2022, I am a 16 year old JavaScript/HTML/CSS tutor for a high school of 3000 active students, getting into some other languages like Python and Java, experimenting with frameworks like selenium and React.js. I am always building my portfolio, and always looking for new opportunities to improve my skills.</p>
                <p>Update: As of July 2023, I am an 18 year old Python programmer that works primarily on projects focused on automation and automotive-related technologies. I work well with selenium and other automated systems, and I am always eager to learn.</p>

                <h2>My goals</h2>
                <p>My goals for my life change rapidly thoughout my exposure to the real world of computer science. Though this is true, one thing stands clear and constant; I want to be able to make a positive impact on the world. I simply want to be able to make lives better while following in what I am most passionate about. My current "dream career" is to be a software engineer for automotive vehicles and to create performance technology systems or innovate on-board computer systems inside of automotive vehicles.</p>
