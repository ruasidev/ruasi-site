            <h1>My Story</h1>
            <p>I first learned the basics of HTML and CSS as a Sophomore in High School. That was the first time I ever programmed anything outside ofscracth. Only starting in 2020, I took an AP Computer Science Principals class as a Junior, and fell in love with JavaScript. My dad had always been a computerperson and we always did projects with computers whenever we got time to. I knew at some point between middle school and high school that I wanted to followin his footsteps and go into computer science. Since then I have been coding as much as possible and doing as much research as possible, taking all of the opportunities that I can get, and that comes to where I am now</p>

            <h2>Where I am now</h2>
            <p>As of February 2022, I am a 16 year old JavaScript/HTML/CSS tutor for a high school of 3000 active students, getting into some other languages like Python and Java,experimenting with frameworks like selenium and React.js. I am always building my portfolio, and always looking for new opportunities to improve my skills.</p>

        <div class="contentsBottomRight">
            <h2>My goals</h2>
            <p>Someday I would love to be in just a job that I enjoy, preferrably a senior developer at FAANG or some other tech giant (obviously). That may be basic, but I think its a solid answer.</p>
